            <h2>I am hugoschieck.io!</h2>

            <p>
                Ok, well, you can call me Hugo. Yep, that's me up there in the top left corner.

            <h3>The Dream:</h3>

            <p>
                I dream a lot. I dream about my future family compound somewhere, actually, in the middle of nowhere. There’s a food forest, animals, you know, chickens, goats, etc.. We need to feed ourselves.
                There’s a wood forest, we need lumber and firewood. Plus, I like to think of myself as a lumberjack. Sustainable forestry, that’s pretty cool. What else? There’s a golf course and a runway for
                my bush plane. Yes. What a dream…
            </p>

            <h3>The Career:</h3>

            <p>
                I am a Data Integration Architect. What’s that? Sometimes, I don’t know either. Computers, gadgets, cars, refrigerators, solar panels, and seemingly everything else these days, they all generate
                data. I design and build the systems needed to capture and bring all of this data together and deliver it to people who can make sense of it all and make better business decisions. While it’s
                challenging, impactful work, and I get to play around with lots of cool technology, honestly, I’m not planning on doing it forever. What’s the plan? Read more.

            <h3>The Hobbies:</h3>

            <p>
                Essentially, other than my addiction to golf, most of my hobbies align to gaining skills to achieve “The Dream.” My wife, son, and I have been dabbling with some raised garden beds on our property,
                with some decent success. I think it’s important, even at a small scale, to learn to grow some of your own food. We’ve been talking about chickens. The gateway bird to livestock. Not sure yet.
                Also, I like to play in the woods, cut down trees, that need to be cut. You know, "clean up" the woods.
            </p>

            <h3>The Plan:</h3>

            <p>
                Invest, more specifically, investing in the stock market. Responsibly. I don’t believe in “get rich quick.” If you’re buying anything that is “get it, whatever it is, quick,” you’re doing it wrong.
                One man’s opinion. I believe that with some discipline, study, and patience, one can achieve some level of financial freedom by investing their way there. I’ll hope to elaborate more as the plan evolves
                over time. So keep coming back for more.

            <h3>The Site:</h3>

            <p>
                My intent here is to simply log our journey through this process. I’ve made my hypothesis: financial freedom is possible. I’m ready to test with my investing experiment. I’ll be documenting results and 
                adjustments along the way. Any step closer to fulfilling “The Dream” is success. Here we go!
